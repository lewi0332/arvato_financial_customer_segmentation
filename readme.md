## Goal

Arvato Financial Service is looking to determine a more efficient method of marketing to customers. Using a data file with information about the general population of Germany and a second file of similar data of current customers. This project uses K-Means clustering to look for attributes of indivduals that match the current customer base.

Next, the project uses similar data from a recent direct mail effort and the subsequent responses to train a model to predict which future mailing are likely to respond. Thereby potentially reducing the cose of future marketing by targeting only those with a higher potential to respond. 

Finally, I will submit the results of the trained model to Kaggle to compete in the corresponding competition to this program.
